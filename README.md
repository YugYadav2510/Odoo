## 🧩 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 3: ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange**  
ReWear is a web-based platform that enables users to share and exchange clothes that they no longer need, encouraging sustainable fashion practices. Users can list their clothing items, browse others' listings, and request swaps. The platform supports both direct exchanges and a point-based system where users earn points by giving away clothes and use them to receive clothes from others.

By reusing and sharing clothing, the platform helps reduce waste, support environmental sustainability, and create a community-driven fashion ecosystem.
